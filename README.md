Gender and Age Detection with Deep Learning
Objective:
To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of a person (face) in a picture or through a webcam.

About the Project:
This Python project utilizes Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. It predicts gender as 'Male' or 'Female' and age in predefined ranges due to the complexity of estimating exact age from a single image.

Dataset:
The project utilizes the Adience dataset, available in the public domain here. The dataset consists of 26,580 photos of 2,284 subjects across various real-world imaging conditions like noise, lighting, pose, and appearance.

Additional Python Libraries Required:
OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
argparse: pip install argparse
